## **So, what is Park Here?**

An interactive web app that functions as an online carpark finding service for drivers. With Park Here, you will be able to find the nearest carparks to your current location, such as shopping malls. After selecting a carpark, you will see the available number of lots, required walking distance and duration, current temperature of the weather and forecast, all in real time!
